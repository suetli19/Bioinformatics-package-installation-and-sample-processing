# fastp to remove adapters and low quality reads
## install fastp https://github.com/OpenGene/fastp
## automate fastp QC on all raw fastq files
while read f; do fastp -i <read1.fastq> -I <read2.fastq> -o <read_filt_1.fastq> -O <read_filt_2.fastq>; done < samplelist.txt

### sanity control here, check manually onf astp report that insert size (merged fwd and rev sequence) is in the range of ~250-255 bp. if not then something is wrong with the trimming process. ###

# DADA2 to trim all sequences to V4 and infer ASVs
## use from https://github.com/jdwiyanto/microbial_genomics_2021/blob/master/meta_analysis_dada2.R and edit accordingly. 
## this step will require some manual QC, to ensure our trimmed length
